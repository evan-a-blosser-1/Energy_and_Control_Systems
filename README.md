## Kalman Filter

This is a State Estimation in Oil Well Drilling. Utilizng a design *Luenberger Observer* a 3-state model was created for the drill speed estimation. With this a *Kalman Filter* was design to estiamte the noise within the system, which is compared to a measured true drill bit velocity to detail teh accuracy. 

**Code is located in HW5 folder**
